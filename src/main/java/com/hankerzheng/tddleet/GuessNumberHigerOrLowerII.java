/**
 * 375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II
 *
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 *
 * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 * Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.
 *
 * However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x.
 * You win the game when you guess the number I picked.
 *
 * Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
